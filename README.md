A paper describing how to hack browser applications or websites using only a console and debugger.

1. By opening a console using CTRL+SHIFT+J, you can try finding valuable information and values using the following commands:

document.all(find all objects and everything available on the document)
window.all(find everything inside the window)

by using this, you can for example find a game object by using document.all called gasvalue and you can change document.all.gasvalue.value to anything you would like or begin scripting mod menus and etc.

By using a debugger, you can pause at any instruction you want and change the value. This is very useful in modding games online, but some games have serverside protection.
